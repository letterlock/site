        following is a bunch of different media that shaped me and continue to inspire me (in no particular order). 
        some of these works have been hugely formative for me, while others are just cool as hell.

        they're all series, which maybe says something about what kind of reader i am.<br>
        as long as i can remember, i've loved series. there's something about being able to
        get into a universe and really <i>live</i> there that has always spoken to me. if i'm being
        cynical, i guess i've always had a reason to escape, but if i'm being hopeful, i think it's
        because i've always been able to see the world's capacity for contingency. it fascinates me,
        just how different things can be, even just on the other side of a door (or a book). <br>
        all of my favourites are some flavour of fantasy, i love other genres, of course, but fantasy
        books were very formative for me, and these stuck with me the most.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_Magic"><i>circle of magic</i></a> - tamora pierce: <br>
            when i said this list was unordered i lied a little. circle of magic gets to be first because
            if you take one thing from my prattling, let it be that you should <i>read these books</i>. <br>
            tamora pierce singlehandedly showed little me what love and beauty looks like. i reread this
            series recently and i cannot shake how beautifully queer and caring and compassionate it is.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dresden_Files"><i>the dresden files</i></a> - jim butcher: <br>
            these books are such an amazing ride. the characters are so compelling and the pacing is
            breakneck from minute one. i love how grounded the magic feels and i love the grungy noir-esque
            detective vibe.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inheritance_Cycle"><i>the inheritance cycle</i></a> - christopher paolini: <br>
            i read these when i was really young. i think in the beginning my mum actually read them to me.
            i remember her struggling with some of the ancient language words and little me confidently
            leaning over and proclaiming how they obviously 'should' be pronounced. patient parents are
            so important. <br>
            also i think the many of the characters in this series contributed to fundamentally altering my brain chemistry 
            and fostering my incoherent, desperate attraction to powerful women.

            they're fun! :^) they start off as fairly typical young adult style books and then eldritch,
            unknowable horrors leak in quietly from the seams between the pages until you're lost in them
            without realising it! :^) they're quick witted and hilarious! :^)

            i can't quite put my finger on it, but there's something very enthralling about these books.
            the universe is extremely compelling and there are so many interesting little touches to the worldbuilding.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld"><i>discworld</i></a> - terry pratchett: <br>
            surprisingly deep and witty, full of social commentary and just really really well written. 
            also has hands down the most interesting interpretation of death as a character i've ever seen.

            little me felt very understood and seen by the characters in here. turns out i had adhd too. figures.<br>
            really cool worldbuilding, heartfelt storytelling, and the worlds most relatable mother.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kingkiller_Chronicle"><i>the kingkiller chronicle</i></a> - patrick rothfuss: <br>
            i always found myself saying "oh you should read this series, i don't know when/if book three is coming
            out but it's still good"... <br>
            recently i've realised that the profound love for these books i have is more important than the 
            conclusion of the story. i'll never forget getting to the end of the book and realising the 
            last chapter mirrored the first, but simultaneously recontextualised the entire story while somehow
            also casting a new tonal light over every event within. also the chapter with felurian is all rhyming
            couplets. prose and poetry are not separate artforms.

        i was never that into this kind of storytelling when i was younger, so a lot of
        these are more recent discoveries for me. i think some of the disinterest is due
        to me always having struggled with the fast turnaround and bite-sized updates of
        much of the medium. i end up forgetting they exist for long stretches of time and
        then feel like i have to reread the whole thing to get the full context. i've never
        <i>disliked</i> them, but recently i've been more appreciative of the medium.

            the art is as good as the story is incomprehensible. somehow you manage to wander from page to page knowing
            fuckall but still being so damn invested in it. i love the unhinged speed of visual and written exposition
            and the absolute refusal to fully tell the reader anything. it shouldn't work... but it does?

            my first real foray into manga. kamome shirahama's art is so fucking amazing. the hatchy, impressionistic
            and slavishly executed style is right up my alley. the characters are all gorgeous and so visually
            interesting and distinct.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Umbrella_Academy"><i>the umbrella academy</i></a> - written: gerard way/art: gabriel bá: <br>
            i read this after watching the tv series of the same name. i love gabriel bá's chunky, shapey art 
            and it has the same unhinged storytelling style as <i>killjoys</i>, but it's tempered somewhat 
            which i think really suits the story.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_Still,_Stay_Silent"><i>stand still, stay silent</i></a> - minna sundberg: <br>
            the first real work of horror or post-apocalyptic fiction that really stuck with me and inspired me.
            historically i've hated consuming horror media of any kind because i'm honestly already scared enough
            as it is, and my vivid imagination often gets the better of me if i get too immersed in something
            horrific. this really showed me that these genres can mean something more than scary for scary's sake
            or 'zombies'. also the art is fantastic. <br>
            i don't really know what to make of the artist's later intense conversion to christianity and 
            subsequent denounciation of <i>SSSS</i> as reflecting her previous 'progressivist' worldview, but, hey,
            i don't think it's hurting anyone so more power to her.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsounded"><i>unsounded</i></a> - ashley cope: <br>
            it's beautiful! i love the characters! i love the story! it's sometimes gory in a frankly unconscionable
            manner! i should go back and read it again!

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestuck"><i>homestuck</i></a> - andrew hussie: <br>
          </li>
          though it's become a meme, i found it so creative and interesting when i was reading it. i never finished it,
          but it gets to be on the list because i find the use of text chat syntax to define characters really fascinating.
