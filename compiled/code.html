        programming projects
      </h1>
      <p>
        here are some of the (not many) programming projects i've created.
        i hope to add more things here in the future, as i do really enjoy coding.<br>
        i've mainly been learning Rust, but i have a very basic familiarity with html,
        css and bash scripting.
        the licenses for each project are available in their respective repositories,
        but as a rule i prefer the GPL.
      </p>
      <h2>
        brr: the perfunctory prose proliferator
      </h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/letterlock/brr">link.</a><br>
        a digital typewriter/prose generation assistant. brr is a barebones text "editor"
        that forces you to write instead of getting stuck editing.<br>
        it does this by disallowing the user from editing any text saved within the file,
        simultaneously saving every few words. additionally, it will save after a period
        of inactivity, so you can't just sit there and think about a sentence you've written
        forever.<br> 
        it's written entirely in rust. it works on linux and windows (and theoretically on osx).
      </p>
      <h2>
        this very website
      </h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/letterlock/site">link.</a>
        i suppose this website technically counts as code i've written. it's not very exciting,
        but if you want to look at the source code (and the bash script i use to make things
        easer to put together -- wow!), it's probably easier to do so in a repository, rather
        than inspecting each page's source with your browser.
